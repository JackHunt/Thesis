Modern machine learning provides much of the semantic and contextual information required to make meaningful inferences 
over the state of the world, as observed by a sensor (such as a camera). Much advancement 
has been made in recent years on the tasks of object detection and semantic understanding in standard, 2D images. However, 
there are many technical challenges that must be overcome before such efficacy on these tasks is reached for the 3D 
case. Many modern AI and machine learning algorithms require vast quantities of data to learn to perform a given task 
successfully. This is not prohibitive for systems that operate on standard 2D images, due to the abundance of available data. 
However, for the 3D case there is not a comparable volume of 3D data with real world geometric information from which a system 
can learn to perform complex tasks in the real world.
