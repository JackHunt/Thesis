% -- 3D sensing equipment allows for geometric modelling of real world
% ---- Reconstructions, 3D motion estimation, pose tracking
% ---- 3D sensing combined with ML allows for rich scene understanding; link back to VR/AR
% ---- 3D data not in abundance, unlike 2D images; harder to train task specific systems
