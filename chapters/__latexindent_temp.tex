Many modern AI and machine learning algorithms require vast quantities of data to learn to 
perform a given task successfully. This is not prohibitive for systems that operate on 
standard 2D images, due to the abundance of available data. However, for the 3D case there 
is not a comparable volume of 3D data with real world geometric information from which a system 
can learn to perform complex tasks in the real world.
