\section{Summary}
~\label{sec:discussion_summary}
This work has outlined novel approaches to various challenges in 3D computer vision, 
including handling dynamics in dense SLAM, reconstructing 3D objects and predicting both 
shape and pose. This chapter evaluates the methods, contributions and outcomes of these 
approaches, with the research objectives outlined in Section~\ref{sec:intro_aims_structure} 
as a point of reference.

This chapter proceeds as follows; first, Section~\ref{subsec:discussion_moseg} provides a 
summary of the dynamic SLAM and motion segmentation approach outlined in Chapter~\ref{chap:moseg}.
Following this, Section~\ref{subsec:discussion_probobj} provides a similar evaluation of the 
approach to object reconstruction outlined in Chapter~\ref{chap:probobj}. Section
~\ref{subsec:discussion_spp} evaluates the approach taken to shape and pose prediction in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:spp}.

Following the evaluations given in Sections~\ref{subsec:discussion_moseg},~\ref{subsec:discussion_probobj} 
and~\ref{chap:spp}, consideration is given to the limitations of the approaches of this work and potential 
future directions in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_limitations}. Finally, a high level conclusion and closing 
remarks are given in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_conclusions}.

\subsection{Real Time Motion Segmentation for Dense Volumetric Fusion}
~\label{subsec:discussion_moseg}
%-> Dense reconstruction with dynamics
%--> Aim to have KF like pipeline with dynamics
%---> Previously prohibitive due to...
%---> Results show...
%--> With RT performance
%--> TODO: measure this
%--> With comparable reconstruction quality
%--> With improved pose estimation
One of the central research objectives outlined in Section~\ref{sec:intro_aims_structure} 
is the development of an algorithm which facilitates the dense reconstruction of dynamic 
environments. As highlighted in Sections~\ref{sec:intro_scene_recon} and
~\ref{sec:lit_review_dynamic}, this has remained a challenging problem in 3D computer vision, 
due to the reliance on prominent pose estimation techniques on reliant point correspondences 
between frames. The novel approach taken in Chapter~\ref{chap:moseg} mitigates the restrictions 
incurred by this depencence by actively excluding dynamic scene components from the pose 
estimation phase of the pipeline, as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:moseg_pipeline}.

As demonstrated in Sections~\ref{sec:moseg_qualitative} and~\ref{sec:moseg_quantitative}, the 
approach taken demonstrates improvements in pose estimation quality over an open implementation
~\cite{Prisacariu2014} of the standard KinectFusion~\cite{Newcombe2011} pipeline when evaluated 
on the \textit{Dynamic Objects} subset of the TUM RGBD dataset~\cite{Sturm2012}. This improved 
performance is evident in Tables~\ref{table:moseg_ate} and~\ref{table:moseg_rte}, and 
Figures~\ref{figure:moseg_ate} and~\ref{figure:moseg_rte}. The improvement in the ability to 
accurately track sensor pose during reconstruction fulfils the research objective of designing 
an angorithm that provides an improvement in pose estimation versus static dense SLAM in dynamic 
scenes.

Additionally, it is evident from Section~\ref{sec:moseg_qualitative} that the proposed approach 
yields high quality reconstructions in dynamic environments that are comparable to their static 
counterparts when there is no motion in the scene. Again, this result is directly satisfying of 
the research objective to design a system that is capable of providing comparable quality 
reconstructions in previously troublesome environments.

%-> Though the contributions of this work..., future work...

%-> Moseg
%--> Limitations
%---> Currently maintains two full SDF's; this can be optimised
%---> Single "moving thing" class; can add more semantics
%--> Future work
%---> Optimise pipeline for better space complexity
%---> Introduce semantics throughout; multi moving things etc
%---> Expand to dynamic semantic slam system; a la spaint

%-> Object reconstruction.
%--> Limitations
%---> Purely observation driven; could better leverage stochastic framework
%---> Requires manual indication of object of interest
%--> Future work
%---> Expand probability framework to directly estimate missing geometry
%---> Exploit advances in saliency to remove manual indication requirement
%---> Multiple objects?
