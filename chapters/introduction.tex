Much has changed since the introduction of the IBM PC platform in 1981, with regards to the 
uses of the Personal Computer and the way in which humans interact with them. Vast increases 
in computational power have seen the microcomputer evolve beyond a tool with which one predominantly 
collated data with spreadsheets (``VisiCalc'' is widely accepted to be the first \textit{killer app}
for the PC). At present, personal computing is ubiquitous, providing the means for activities ranging 
from playing visually realistic 3D games, to sharing life events online with friends and family via 
so called ``Social Media'' platforms. Advances in graphics processing power have lead to the introduction 
of many technologies that both the public sector and private enterprises have come to depend on, from 
sophisticated medical image analysis, to robotic production lines.

The aforementioned vast power of the modern GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) has lead to the development 
of new ways for humans to interact with computers, and for computers to interact with the world. Advances 
in VR (Virtual Reality) allow humans to experience digital worlds in a fully immersive manner, with 
applications ranging from gaming, to experimental therapeutic treatment of Paranoid Schizophrenia. 
Whereas AR (Augmented Reality) allows a person to supplement their perception of the tangible world with 
elements of the digital, by viewing the world through a computer system that percieves and adds synthetic 
components. Common applications of AR include digital interior design and smartphone games.

Many of the aforementioned advancements in the applications of and interactions with modern computer 
systems are driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Modern AI provides much of the semantic and contextual 
information required to make meaningful inferences over the state of the world, as observed by a sensor 
(such as a camera) attached to such a computer system. Much advancement has been made in recent years on 
the tasks of object detection and semantic understanding in standard, 2D images. However, there are many 
technical challenges that must be overcome before such efficacy on these tasks is reached for the 3D 
case. Many modern AI and machine learning algorithms require vast quantities of data to learn to 
perform a given task successfully. This is not prohibitive for systems that operate on 
standard 2D images, due to the abundance of available data. However, for the 3D case there 
is not a comparable volume of 3D data with real world geometric information from which a system 
can learn to perform complex tasks in the real world.

% -- 3D sensing equipment allows for geometric modelling of real world

% Elaborate on current challenges.
% -- Dynamics in SLAM
% ---- for SLAM in real environments (working environments such as warehouses), no consistent model
% ---- fragility leads to problems; complete failure to inaccuracies
% ---- reliance on point correspondences; efficacious for static, fails for dynamic
% ---- no dynamics = limited perception capability; needed for "real" environments
% ---- dynamics provide semantic information
% -- Object centric SLAM/SfM
% ---- preliminary work limited on simultaneous TaM; offline or known pose
% ---- fundamentally a difficult problem; less to work with
% ---- geometric inconsistencies more pronounced effect; bad training data etc
% -- Data driven pose/shape regression
% ---- complex environments may not allow long enough to fuse model
% ---- larger scale makes dense reconstruction infeasable
% ---- limited observability; not able to fully cover object
% ---- eliminate many lower level "tricks" to make reconstruction work

% ---- real time?
% ---- comparable reconstruction quality to state of art?
% ---- can we improve tracking in these scenarios?
% -- Can we determine what is dynamic in a scene?
% ---- Can we leverage this information in some semantic way (link back to AR applications/data collection)?
% -- Can we obtain consistent reconstructions of arbitrary objects?

% -- Can we infer scene properties where traditional reconstruction not possible?
% ---- shape and pose?
% ---- without requiring temporal consistency?; avert tracking errors
