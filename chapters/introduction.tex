% ---- ad-hoc ML (3d data procurement etc)
% -- Current challenges
% ---- fragility in complex, real environments (dynamics etc)
% ---- lack of real world data for learning of 3d
% ---- SLAM limited to observations only; may not see whole thing; may not be practical etc

% Elaborate on current challenges.
% -- Dynamics in SLAM
% ---- for SLAM in real environments (working environments such as warehouses), no consistent model
% ---- fragility leads to problems; complete failure to inaccuracies
% ---- reliance on point correspondences; efficacious for static, fails for dynamic
% ---- no dynamics = limited perception capability; needed for "real" environments
% ---- dynamics provide semantic information
% -- Object centric SLAM/SfM
% ---- preliminary work limited on simultaneous TaM; offline or known pose
% ---- fundamentally a difficult problem; less to work with
% ---- geometric inconsistencies more pronounced effect; bad training data etc
% -- Data driven pose/shape regression
% ---- complex environments may not allow long enough to fuse model
% ---- larger scale makes dense reconstruction infeasable
% ---- limited observability; not able to fully cover object
% ---- eliminate many lower level "tricks" to make reconstruction work

% Research questions.
% -- Can we reconstruct densely in dynamic scenes?
% ---- real time?
% ---- comparable reconstruction quality to state of art?
% ---- can we improve tracking in these scenarios?
% -- Can we determine what is dynamic in a scene?
% ---- Can we leverage this information in some semantic way (link back to AR applications/data collection)?
% -- Can we obtain consistent reconstructions of arbitrary objects?
% ---- comparable reconstruction quality to state of the art scene based?
% ---- with commodity hardware?; wider applicability
% ---- without known pose?
% ---- 
% -- Can we infer scene properties where traditional reconstruction not possible?
% ---- shape and pose?
% ---- without requiring temporal consistency?; avert tracking errors
% ----
