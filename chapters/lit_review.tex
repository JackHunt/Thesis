\section{Tracking and Mapping}
\label{sec:lit_review_tam}
There has been much research in the field of Tracking and Mapping in recent 
years, with many large scale works being driven by the availibility of once 
costly depth sensing equipment. The availability of such equipment combined 
with the ever increasingly parallel nature of modern GPU's has seen the 
field advance greatly beyond the seminal but resource limited works of it's 
infancy. This advancement is most predominant within the Dense SLAM(Simultaneous 
Localisation and Mapping) literature. This section shall first explore the 
earlier, fundamental works of this area of research, followed by a treatment 
of the current state of the art.

\textit{Besl \& McKay} \cite{Besl1992} introduced their seminal work on 3D shape 
registration in 1992, providing a method to estimate full 6DoF(Six Degrees of 
Freedom) pose between 3D point sets. The authors present an Iterative Closest 
Point Algorithm that consists of three operations per iteration; computation 
of closest point, computation of a 6DoF Transformation and application of 
the Transformation. The authors present a proof of convergence based on that 
of Least Squares minimisation, however there must be sufficiently complex 
geometry present in the structure of the data to optimise to a meaningful 
Transformation.

Complementary to the aforementioned works of \textit{Besl \& McKay} \cite{Besl1992} 
in the foundational aspects of Dense SLAM is that of \textit{Curless \& Levoy} 
\cite{Curless1996}, 1996. The authors present an early volumetric integration 
framework for the reconstruction of shapes from range data obtained from a 
sensor such as a laser scanner. The authors introduce the SDF(Signed Distance Function), 
a volumetric, implicit shape representation in which entries are cumulatively updated 
in a weighted manner. Once observations have been integrated in to the SDF volume, an 
Isosurface representation of the shape is extracted by a Marching Cubes \cite{MC} 
procedure. Though the approach may lead to gaps in the resultant model, the authors 
mitigate this by introducing a Surface Tesselation step.

Later work by \textit{Zhou et al} \cite{Zhou2008} in 2008 introduces an alternative 
shape representation to that of \textit{Curless \& Levoy} \cite{Curless1996}, based 
on the spatial KD-Tree data structure and a highly data parallel BFS(Breadth First 
Search) construction algorithm. The level of parallelism introduced allows for 
application to problems that require real time performance. The authors provide 
examples of use in Ray Tracing \cite{RT} and Photon Mapping \cite{PM}.

In the same year, \textit{Censi} \cite{Censi2008} introduced \textit{PL-ICP}, a 
variant of the ICP algorithm introduced by \textit{Besl \& McKay} \cite{Besl1992}. 
The presented approach utilises a Point-to-Line metric rather than a Point-to-Point 
metric and has a closed form solution in the planar case. For the non planar case 
the presented approach acheives quadratic convergence in a finite number of steps, 
utilising a Normal weighting and a Lagrangian optimisation scheme. However, it is 
highlighted that prior to the optimisation procedure it is necessary to trim outliers 
from the point data sets.

Culminating much of the aforementioned work, in 2011 \textit{Newcombe et al} introduced 
the seminal \textit{KinectFusion} pipeline, allowing for real time mapping of indoor 
scenes with the Kinect RGBD sensor from Microsoft. The authors utilise a sparser form 
of the SDF structure introduced by \textit{Curless \& Levoy} \cite{Curless1996}, the 
TSDF(Truncated Signed Distance Function), allowing for reconstruction at scene scale. 
For pose estimation, a multi-level variant of the ICP algorithm utilising a Point-to-Plane 
metric similar to that of \textit{PL-ICP} \cite{Censi2008} is used. The pipeline consists 
of four phases; \textit{Measurement}, \textit{Integration}, \textit{Isosurface Extraction} 
and \textit{Pose Update}. Applications of the presented system however are limited only to 
those that require the reconstruction of static scenes; dynamic scenes are not supported 
by \textit{KinectFusion}.

Further optimisations were made in 2013 by \textit{Nei{\ss}ner at al} to the \textit{KinectFusion} 
pipeline proposed by \textit{Newcombe et al}. The authors introduce a spatially hashed TSDF data 
structure, in which the TSDF is split in to hashed Voxel Blocks allowing for very fast Voxel 
lookups. The presented approach yields low space and time complexity for such operations, vastly 
increasing the potential for real time, large scale use. Additionally, a streaming system is 
introduced to dynamically handle data transmission between the CPU and GPU, allowing for the 
reconstruction of scenes that may exceed the GRAM bounds of commodity GPU's. The proposed 
system is capable of running at $\approx46Hz$ on an NVIDIA Titan GPU.
