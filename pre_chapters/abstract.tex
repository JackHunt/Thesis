Advances in 3D computer vision have tremendously impacted the way that humans and computers interact. 
Applications of 3D vision, such as Virtual Reality video games and robotics are underpinned by a range of 
computer vision competencies, including pose estimation, mapping and semantic understanding. However, 
many challenging research problems remain, three of which are the focus of this work.

Firstly, an approach to the difficult task of dense mapping in dynamic environments is proposed, utilising a 
novel representation of the scene that allows for dynamic components to be separately handled from their 
static counterparts. The proposed approach demonstrates an improvement in pose estimation accuracy in dynamic scenes, 
versus it's common, static counterpart. Additionally, it exceeds real-time performance, and may be leveraged for simple 
semantics.

The second topic of this Thesis is 3D object reconstruction, with a novel representation and formulation that provides 
online error correction. This approach demonstrates improvements over a state-of-the-art method. Additionally, the efficacy 
of the online correction procedure is demonstrated versus a vanilla approach, with high levels of geometric accuracy.

The final focus of this work is the simultaneous inference of object shape and pose in large scale, outdoor environments. 
This approach regresses shape and pose in a weakly-supervised manner, utilising a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks 
and Gaussian Processes. Early results indicate\dots

This Thesis is intended to provide a strong foundation for further research in the area of geometrically driven 3D scene 
understanding. However, immediate applications are evident. The motion segmentation and dense mapping approach allows for operation 
in previously prohibitive scenarios, such as robotics. The 3D object reconstruction work of the Thesis is applicable to the collection of 
geometrically consistent 3D object data. Finally, the simultaneous inference of shape and pose is applicable to modelling scenarios of 
specific semantic interest, where an entire scene need not be reconstructed, preliminarily demonstrating potential for large 
scale, semi-dense, geometric mapping.
