I would first like to express my gratitude to the Engineering and Physical Sciences 
Research Council for their support of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Autonomous, 
Intelligent Machines and Systems, without which I could not have embarked on my DPhil 
journey. 

Additionally, I cannot understate my gratitude to the personnel of the AIMS 
CDT who from the very beginning have been supportive and encouraging. In particular, I 
would like to thank Wendy Adams for her personal support when I have faced difficulties 
and for introducing me to the Fish Finger Sandwich at the Royal Oak!

Of course, none of the work contained in this Thesis would have been possible without the 
support and guidance of my DPhil supervisors, Prof\@. Philip Torr and Prof\@. Victor Prisacariu. 
The work that they have overseen in their respective research groups has been a source of 
academic inspiration. Additionally, I would like to extend my thanks to Stuart Golodetz and 
Michael Sapienza, both of whom helped me immeasureably at the start.

Of course, my partner Zoe, my family and my friends must be noted here for their continued patience 
with me for the duration of my DPhil. I am sure that I have been difficult at times!
